Here we use ab initio path integral simulations to elucidate the role of nuclear quantum effects in determining the charge transfer in a range of hydrogen bonded species in the gas and liquid phase. We show that the quantization of the nuclei gives rise to large changes in the magnitude of the charge transfer as well as its temperature dependence. We then explain how a single geometric parameter determines the charge transfer through the hydrogen bond. These results thus demonstrate that nuclear quantum effects are vital for the accurate description of charge transfer and offer a physically transparent way to understand how hydrogen bonding gives rise to it.},

This approach yields an excellent agreement with a mean absolute deviation as small as 0.04 kJ mol−1 for the interaction energy between helium and both hydronium and Zundel cations compared with coupled cluster reference calculations with an energetically converged basis set.

abstract = {The mechanochemistry of ring-opening reactions of cyclopropane derivatives turns out to be unexpectedly rich and puzzling. After showing that a rare so-called uphill bifurcation in the case of trans-gem-difluorocyclopropane turns into a downhill bifurcation upon substitution of fluorine by chlorine, bromine, and iodine in the thermal activation limit, the dichloro derivative is studied systematically in the realm of mechanochemical activation. Detailed exploration of the force-transformed potential energy surface of trans-gem-dichlorocyclopropane in terms of Dijkstra path analysis unveils a hitherto unknown topological catastrophe where the global shape of the energy landscape is fundamentally changed. From thermal activation up to moderately large forces, it is an uphill bifurcation that decides about dis- versus conrotatory ring-opening followed by separate transition states along both pathways. Above a critical force, the two distinct transition states merge to yield a single transition state such that the decision about the dis- versus conrotatory ring-opening process is taken at a newly established downhill bifurcation. The discovery of a force-induced qualitative change of the topology of a reaction network vastly transcends the previous understanding of the ring-opening reaction of this species. It would be astonishing to not discover a wealth of such catastrophes for mechanochemically activated reactions, which will greatly extend the known opportunities to manipulate chemical reaction networks.},

abstract = {Many experimental techniques such as tagging photodissociation and helium nanodroplet isolation spectroscopy operate at very low temperatures in order to investigate hydrogen bonding. To elucidate the differences between such ultra-cold and usual ambient conditions, different hydrogen bonded systems are studied systematically from 300 K down to about 1 K using path integral simulations that explicitly consider both the quantum nature of the nuclei and thermal fluctuations. For this purpose, finite sized water clusters, specifically the water dimer and hexamer, protonated water clusters including the Zundel and Eigen complexes, as well as hexagonal ice as a condensed phase representative are compared directly as a function of temperature. While weaker hydrogen bonds, as present in the neutral systems, show distinct structural differences between ambient conditions and the ultra-cold regime, the stronger hydrogen bonds of the protonated water clusters are less perturbed by temperature compared to their quantum ground state. In all the studied systems, the quantum delocalization of the nuclei is found to vary drastically with temperature. Interestingly, upon reaching temperatures of about 1 K, the spatial quantum delocalization of the heavy oxygens approaches that of the protons for relatively weak spatial constraints, and even significantly exceeds the latter in the case of the centered hydrogen bond in the Zundel complex. These findings are relevant for comparisons between experiments on hydrogen bonding carried out under ultra-cold versus ambient conditions as well as to understand quantum delocalization phenomena of nuclei by seamlessly extending our insights into noncovalent interactions down to ultra-low temperatures.},

abstract = {Highly accurate potential energy surfaces are of key interest for the detailed understanding and predictive modeling of chemical systems. In recent years, several new types of force fields, which are based on machine learning algorithms and fitted to ab initio reference calculations, have been introduced to meet this requirement. Here, we show how high-dimensional neural network potentials can be employed to automatically generate the potential energy surface of finite sized clusters at coupled cluster accuracy, namely CCSD(T*)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ. The developed automated procedure utilizes the established intrinsic properties of the model such that the configurations for the training set are selected in an unbiased and efficient way to minimize the computational effort of expensive reference calculations. These ideas are applied to protonated water clusters from the hydronium cation, H3O+, up to the tetramer, H9O4+, and lead to a single potential energy surface that describes all these systems at essentially converged coupled cluster accuracy with a fitting error of 0.06 kJ/mol per atom. The fit is validated in detail for all clusters up to the tetramer and yields reliable results not only for stationary points but also for reaction pathways and intermediate configurations as well as different sampling techniques. Per design, the neural network potentials (NNPs) constructed in this fashion can handle very different conditions including the quantum nature of the nuclei and enhanced sampling techniques covering very low as well as high temperatures. This enables fast and exhaustive exploration of the targeted protonated water clusters with essentially converged interactions. In addition, the automated process will allow one to tackle finite systems much beyond the present case.},

abstract = {Superfluid helium has not only fascinated scientists for centuries but is also the ideal matrix for the investigation of chemical systems under ultra-cold conditions in helium nanodroplet isolation experiments. Together with related experimental techniques such as helium tagging photodissociation spectroscopy, these methods have provided unique insights into many interesting systems. Complemented by theoretical work, they were additionally able to greatly expand our general understanding of manifestations of superfluid behavior in finite sized clusters and their response to molecular impurities. However, most theoretical studies up to now have not included the reactivity and flexibility of molecular systems embedded in helium. In this perspective, the theoretical foundation of simulating fluxional molecules and reactive complexes in superfluid helium is presented in detail. Special emphasis is put on recent developments for the converged description of both the molecular interactions and the quantum nature of the nuclei at ultra-low temperatures. As a first step, our hybrid path integral molecular dynamics/bosonic path integral Monte Carlo method is reviewed. Subsequently, methods for efficient path integral sampling tailored for this hybrid coupling scheme are discussed while also introducing new developments to enhance the accurate incorporation of the solute⋯solvent coupling. Finally, highly accurate descriptions of the interactions in solute⋯helium systems using machine learning techniques are addressed. Our current automated and adaptive fitting procedures to parameterize high-dimensional neural network potentials for both the full-dimensional potential energy surface of solutes and the solute⋯solvent interaction potentials are concisely presented. They are demonstrated to faithfully represent many-body potential functions able to describe chemically complex and reactive solutes in helium environments seamlessly from one He atom up to bulk helium at the accuracy level of coupled cluster electronic structure calculations. Together, these advances allow for converged quantum simulations of fluxional and reactive solutes in superfluid helium under cryogenic conditions.},

abstract = {It is well known in the field of machine learning that committee models improve accuracy, provide generalization error estimates, and enable active learning strategies. In this work, we adapt these concepts to interatomic potentials based on artificial neural networks. Instead of a single model, multiple models that share the same atomic environment descriptors yield an average that outperforms its individual members as well as a measure of the generalization error in the form of the committee disagreement. We not only use this disagreement to identify the most relevant configurations to build up the model's training set in an active learning procedure but also monitor and bias it during simulations to control the generalization error. This facilitates the adaptive development of committee neural network potentials and their training sets while keeping the number of ab initio calculations to a minimum. To illustrate the benefits of this methodology, we apply it to the development of a committee model for water in the condensed phase. Starting from a single reference ab initio simulation, we use active learning to expand into new state points and to describe the quantum nature of the nuclei. The final model, trained on 814 reference calculations, yields excellent results under a range of conditions, from liquid water at ambient and elevated temperatures and pressures to different phases of ice, and the air-water interface - all including nuclear quantum effects. This approach to committee models will enable the systematic development of robust machine learning models for a broad range of systems.},

abstract = {We employ the kth nearest-neighbor estimator of configurational entropy in order to decode within a parameter-free numerical approach the complex high-order structural correlations in fluxional molecules going much beyond the usual linear, bivariate correlations. This generic entropy-based scheme for determining many-body correlations is applied to the complex configurational ensemble of protonated acetylene, a prototype for fluxional molecules featuring large-Amplitude motion. After revealing the importance of high-order correlations beyond the simple two-coordinate picture for this molecule, we analyze in detail the evolution of the relevant correlations with temperature as well as the impact of nuclear quantum effects down to the ultralow temperature regime of 1 K. We find that quantum delocalization and zero-point vibrations significantly reduce all correlations in protonated acetylene in the deep quantum regime. Even at low temperatures up to about 100 K, most correlations are essentially absent in the quantum case and only gain importance at higher temperatures. In the high temperature regime, beyond roughly 800 K, the increasing thermal fluctuations are found to exert a destructive effect on the presence of correlations. At intermediate temperatures of approximately 100-800 K, a quantum-To-classical cross-over regime is found where classical mechanics starts to correctly describe trends in the correlations whereas it even qualitatively fails below 100 K. Finally, a classical description of the nuclei provides correlations that are in quantitative agreement with the quantum ones only at temperatures exceeding 1000 K. This data-intensive analysis has been made possible due to recent developments of machine learning techniques based on high-dimensional neural network potential energy surfaces in full dimensionality that allow us to exhaustively sample both the classical and quantum ensemble of protonated acetylene at essentially converged coupled cluster accuracy from 1 to more than 1000 K. The presented non-parametric analysis of correlations beyond usual linear two-coordinate terms is transferable to other system classes. The technique is also expected to complement and guide the analysis of experimental measurements, in particular multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy, by revealing the complex coupling between various degrees of freedom.},

Schran, J. Behler, and D. Marx, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16, 88 (2020)] is applied to the protonated water hexamer, H+(H2O)6 - a system that the neural network has never seen before. Although being in the extrapolation regime, it is shown that the potential not only allows for quantum simulations from ultra-low temperatures ∼1 K up to 300 K but is also able to describe the new system very accurately compared to explicit coupled cluster calculations. This transferability of the model is rationalized by the similarity of the atomic environments encountered for the larger cluster compared to the environments in the training set of the model. Compared to the interpolation regime, the quality of the model is reduced by roughly one order of magnitude, but most of the difference to the coupled cluster reference comes from global shifts of the potential energy surface, while local energy fluctuations are well recovered. These results suggest that the application of neural network potentials in extrapolation regimes can provide useful results and might be more general than usually thought.},

After an initial ab initio simulation, a machine learning potential is constructed with minimum human effort through a data-driven active learning protocol. Such models can afterwards be applied in exhaustive simulations to provide reliable answers for the scientific question at hand.

The systems chosen here comprise water with different ions in solution, water on a titanium dioxide surface, as well as water confined in nanotubes and between molybdenum disulfide sheets. Highlighting the accuracy of our approach compared to the ab initio reference, the resulting models are evaluated in detail with an automated validation protocol that includes structural and dynamical properties and the precision of the force prediction of the models. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of our approach for the description of water on the rutile titanium dioxide (110) surface to analyze structure and mobility of water on this surface.

By imaging over 70,000 single adatom adsorption sites, we compare the site preference and dynamic motion of the adatoms in both a fully hydrated and vacuum state. We find a modified adsorption site distribution and higher diffusivities for the adatoms in liquid phase compared to those in vacuum.

This includes tagging with one or very few pH2, the microsolvation regime, and matrix isolation. However, the fundamental coupling between the bosonic pH2 environment and the (ro-)vibrational motion of molecular impurities remains poorly understood. Quantum simulations can in provide the necessary atomistic insight, but very accurate descriptions of the involved interactions are required. Here, we present a data-driven approach for the generation of impurity-pH2 interaction potentials based on machine learning techniques which retain the full flexibility of the impurity. We employ the well-established adiabatic hindered rotor (AHR) averaging technique to include the impact of the nuclear spin statistics on the symmetry-allowed rotational quantum numbers of pH2. Embedding this averaging procedure within the high-dimensional neural network potential (NNP) framework enables the generation of highly-accurate AHR-averaged NNPs at coupled cluster accuracy, namely CCSD(T*)-F12a/aVTZcp in an automated manner. We apply this methodology to the water and protonated water molecules, as representative cases for quasi-rigid and highly-flexible molecules respectively, and obtain AHR-averaged NNPs that reliably describe the H2O-pH2 and H3O+-pH2 interactions. Using path integral simulations we show for the hydronium cation that umbrella-like tunneling inversion has a strong impact on the first and second pH2 microsolvation shells. The data-driven nature of our protocol opens the door to the study of bosonic pH2 quantum solvation for a wide range of embedded impurities.},
