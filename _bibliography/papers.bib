abstract = {Simulation techniques based on accurate and efficient representations of potential energy surfaces are urgently needed for the understanding of complex aqueous systems such as solid-liquid interfaces. Here, we present a machine learning framework that enables the efficient development and validation of models for complex aqueous systems. Instead of trying to deliver a globally-optimal machine learning potential, we propose to develop models applicable to specific thermodynamic state points in a simple and user-friendly process. After an initial ab initio simulation, a machine learning potential is constructed with minimum human effort through a data-driven active learning protocol. Such models can afterwards be applied in exhaustive simulations to provide reliable answers for the scientific question at hand. We showcase this methodology on a diverse set of aqueous systems with increasing degrees of complexity. The systems chosen here comprise water with different ions in solution, water on a titanium dioxide surface, as well as water confined in nanotubes and between molybdenum disulfide sheets. Highlighting the accuracy of our approach compared to the ab initio reference, the resulting models are evaluated in detail with an automated validation protocol that includes structural and dynamical properties and the precision of the force prediction of the models. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of our approach for the description of water on the rutile titanium dioxide (110) surface to analyze structure and mobility of water on this surface. Such machine learning models provide a straightforward and uncomplicated but accurate extension of simulation time and length scales for complex systems.},

@article{Thiemann2022/10.1021/acsnano.2c02784,
abstract = {Experimental measurements have reported ultra-fast and radius-dependent water transport in carbon nanotubes which are absent in boron nitride nanotubes. Despite considerable effort, the origin of this contrasting (and fascinating) behaviour is not understood. Here, with the aid of machine learning-based molecular dynamics simulations that deliver first-principles accuracy, we investigate water transport in single-wall carbon and boron nitride nanotubes. Our simulations reveal a large, radius-dependent hydrodynamic slippage on both materials with water experiencing indeed a {\$}\backslashapprox 5{\$} times lower friction on carbon surfaces compared to boron nitride. Analysis of the diffusion mechanisms across the two materials reveals that the fast water transport on carbon is governed by facile oxygen motion, whereas the higher friction on boron nitride arises from specific hydrogen-nitrogen interactions. This work not only delivers a clear reference of unprecedented accuracy for water flow in single-wall nanotubes, but also provides detailed mechanistic insight into its radius and material dependence for future technological application.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
