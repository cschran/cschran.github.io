Welcome to my webpage!

As an expert in theoretical chemistry, I'm fascinated by the study of water
by means of computational methods. In recent time, I primarily focus on developing `machine learning techniques` in order to provide insight into complex aqueous systems, for which accurate and efficient representations of potential energy surfaces are urgently needed.

I am Christoph Schran, a research fellow at the Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry of the University of Cambridge, working closely with <a href='https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/michaelides/person/am452'>Angelos Michaelides</a> in the ICE group where water is put at the center of our research interests.
Before coming to the UK, I was a post-doctoral researcher with Ondrej Marsalek at Charles University in Prague. I received my PhD in Theoretical Chemistry from the University of Bochum, where I worked with Dominik Marx on understanding the properties of hydrogen bonding at ultra-low temperatures in superfluid quantum solvents.
During that time, I had the honor to visit the groups of Tom Markland in Stanford and Rodolphe Vuilleumier at ENS in Paris.

My research portfolio comprises the following techniques:
<ul>
    <li>Machine Learning Potentials, Neural Network Potentials, Active Learning</li>
    <li>Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics, Density Functional Theory</li>
    <li>Nuclear Quantum Effects, Path Integral Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo, Bosonic Exchange</li>
    <li>Reaching Coupled Cluster Accuracy</li>
</ul>
